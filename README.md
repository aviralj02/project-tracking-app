# Project Tracking App (using Spring Framework)
This project is an application designed for project management and tracking built with robust Spring Framework. It comprises of two modules:
1. Admin Module: This module empowers administrators to effortlessly add, update, or delete project details. Additionally, they can assign projects to different users within the system.
2. User Module: Users have the capability to register and log into the application. Once logged in, they can view the projects assigned to them by the administrators. The user module also provides functionality to change the status of projects, marking them as "TO DO," "IN PROGRESS," or "COMPLETE." Furthermore, users can add comments to the projects they are involved in, facilitating effective communication and collaboration.

To enhance the application's functionality, logging capabilities have been incorporated using Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming).
